       "'The city of Chicago is divided into 77 community areas for statistical and planning purposes. Census data and other statistics are tied to the areas, which serve as the basis for a variety of urban planning initiatives on both the local and regional levels. The areas\\' boundaries do not generally change, allowing comparisons of statistics across time. The areas are distinct from but related to the more numerous neighborhoods of Chicago; an area often corresponds to a neighborhood or encompasses several neighborhoods, but the areas do not always correspond to popular conceptions of the neighborhoods due to a number of factors including historical evolution and choices made by the creators of the areas. As of 2020, Near North Side is the most populous of the areas with over 105,000 residents, while Burnside is the least populous with just over 2,500. Other geographical divisions of Chicago exist, such as the \"sides\" created by the branches of the Chicago River, the wards of the Chicago City Council, and the parishes of the Roman Catholic Church.\\nThe Social Science Research Committee at the University of Chicago defined the community areas in the 1920s based on neighborhoods or groups of related neighborhoods within the city. In this effort it was led by sociologists Robert E. Park and Ernest Burgess, who believed that physical contingencies created areas that would inevitably form a common identity. Except for the addition of two areas (O\\'Hare from land annexed by the city in 1956 and Edgewater\\'s separation from Uptown in 1980) and expansions due to minor annexations, the areas\\' boundaries have never been revised to reflect change but instead have been kept stable. The areas have become a part of the culture of Chicago, contributing to its perception as a \"city of neighborhoods\" and breaking it down into smaller regions for easier analysis and local planning. Nevertheless, Park\\'s and Burgess\\'s ideas on the inevitability of physically related areas forming a common bond have been questioned, and the unchanging nature of the areas has at times been considered problematic with major subsequent changes in the urban landscape such as the construction of expressways.'"

       "'The Rogers Park area was colonized at the convergence of two Native American trails predating modern metropolitan Chicago, that evolved into Rogers Avenue and Ridge Boulevard. The Pottawatomi and other regional tribes settled in Rogers Park from season to season. The name of Indian Boundary Park west of Rogers Park reflects this history as does Pottawattomie Park near Clark Street and Rogers Avenue.\\nIn 1809, the Karthauser Inn was established as stagecoach stop and tavern. Phillip Rogers of Ireland purchased 1,600 acres (650 ha) of land in the area from the 1830s to 1856. He operated a toll gate beside his home at what became Ridge and Lunt Avenues and often traded and worked with the local tribes.\\nDuring the period 1844 to 1850 arriving colonizers started farms along a ridge in the western portion of Rogers Park, avoiding the often flooded lowlands to the east.  In 1870 Rogers\\' son-in-law, Patrick I. Touhy, sold 100 acres (40 ha) to land speculators, including John Farwell, Luther Greenleaf, Stephen Lunt, Charles Morse, and George Estes; all of whom contributed names to streets in the area.  With an additional purchase of 125 acres in 1873 these speculators together with Touhy formed the Rogers Park Building and Land Company.  Also in 1873, the Chicago & Northwestern Railway completed a line through the area and constructed a station at Greenleaf Ave.  The population was 200 and a post office was opened in July 1873.On April 29, 1878, voters incorporated Rogers Park as a village of Illinois governed by six trustees. In 1885, the Chicago, Evanston & Lake Superior Railroad, a predecessor of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, built a combination freight and commuter line through eastern Rogers Park on the present \"L\" right-of-way with a stop at Morse Avenue. By 1893, the population was 3500, the North Shore Electric Railroad expanded its service into the area, and the village of Rogers Park was annexed to Chicago.The Rogers Park Women\\'s Club opened the first library in 1894. In that year, the Great Fire of Rogers Park destroyed the business district.'"
