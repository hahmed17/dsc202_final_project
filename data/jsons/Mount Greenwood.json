[{"History":"In the mid-nineteenth century, German and Dutch farmers settled the area. The region received its name in 1879 when the surveyor George Washington Waite platted an eighty-acre land grant that he had received from the federal government.The proliferation of saloons led to a movement to turn Mount Greenwood into a \"dry area\" like the nearby communities of Morgan Park and Beverly. To prevent this, a group of citizens successfully campaign to incorporate Mount Greenwood as a village. Twenty years later, in 1927, the community voted to be annexed into Chicago to receive better services. The promised infrastructure took longer than anticipated to be delivered due to the Great Depression. Those services finally came nine years later, in 1936, when the Works Progress Administration installed sewers. Residents were still seeking improvements such as curbs into the 1960s. Despite being annexed by Chicago, the area maintained a character similar to nearby blue collar city-suburbs.Mount Greenwood was home to the last farm in Chicago, owned by Peter Ouwenga until the mid-1980s when he sold his farm to the Chicago Public School system. The district built the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences on Peter Ouwenga's land, an experimental magnet high school devoted to teaching agricultural science to urban students. It was the second school of its kind after W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia.","Racial tension":"Mount Greenwood's history has been characterized by racial tension. In the 1970s, a Mount Greenwood civic group, joined two other community groups to file a complaint with the Department of Justice over racial quotas at the Robert Black Mini-Magnet school that allegedly favored minorities. In 1992, The New York Times interviewed over one hundred residents of Mount Greenwood and Roseland in which Mount Greenwood residents seemingly endorsed the de facto segregation and expressed their beliefs in welfare queens and other stereotypes. Around the same time as the New York Times piece, residents successfully managed to restrict the number of minority students who could attend Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences which at the time had a predominantly black student body. In the late 1990s, an African-American family alleged that they were driven out of the neighborhood by persistent vandalism and harassment. In 2016, the area was the site of a clash between the Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter movements after the latter came to Mount Greenwood to protest after the shooting of 25-year-old Joshua Beal by an off duty police officer.","Geography":"Its approximate borders are 103rd Street to the north, 117th Street to the south, Pulaski Road to the west, and Sacramento Avenue to the east.
