[{"History":"In 1837, Hegewisch, along with the area that now composes most of the South Side of Chicago, was incorporated as part of Hyde Park Township.In 1883, Adolph Hegewisch, president of U.S. Rolling Stock Company, selected the area to build a company town. He announced his ambition to build two canals. The first would have shortened the Calumet River; the second would connect Wolf Lake with Lake Michigan. His plans were never realized due to a lack of capital. In 1889, Hyde Park Township voted to be annexed into the City of Chicago. A few years after the area was annexed, Adolph Hegewisch died and his company was absorbed into the Pressed Steel Car Company.In the early 20th century, the area became home to a large number of steel mills. A large number of Polish immigrants came to Hegewisch to work in the steel mills. In the 1930s, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee became active in the area. Eventually, they were able to have Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company recognize the union. Emboldened, the union organized a strike against smaller steel companies. When workers attempted to march on Republic Steel, they were shot at by the Chicago Police Department. Ten unarmed workers died and hundreds were injured.Starting in the 1970s, employment in the steel industry began trending downward hurting areas that relied on steel mills. In 1980, Wisconsin Steel closed its South Deering mill, leading to high unemployment in the area. Further closures compounded this effect.During this decline, a variety of economic development projects were proposed. In 1990, Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed the Lake Calumet Airport, which would have resulted in the demolition of all of Hegewisch, along with portions of nearby Burnham and Calumet City. The airport faced staunch opposition from Hegewisch residents. After facing opposition from Illinois Senate president Pate Philip and concerns over the cost of the airport, Daley declared the airport proposal \"dead\" and focused on plans to expand O'Hare International Airport.Though Hegewisch suffered from the decline of heavy industry, the neighborhood did not witness the extreme devastation that other neighborhoods like South Chicago or Pullman did. Today, Hegewisch is a stable middle and working-class neighborhood, with roughly average levels of household income, and below-average crime and poverty (relative to the city of Chicago as a whole). A large number of city police and firefighters live in the neighborhood.","Geography":"The northern border of Hegewisch is 128th St. Its eastern border is the Illinois-Indiana state line.

It includes the area north of 138th St, south of 130th St., east of Torrence Avenue, and west of Avenue O. Arizona, named because of the sandy nature of the original soil and presence of the native cactus, is east of Avenue O and north of 138th St. It is synonymous with \"the Avenues\". The Avenues receives its name from the unique street naming convention of alphabetically named streets (e.g. Avenue F, Avenue G, etc.). The newest neighborhood is Avalon Trails, built primarily in the 1960s. It is north of 130th Street, east of Torrence Avenue and west of Baltimore Avenue.Hegewisch also contains Chicago's only trailer park. Harbor Point Estates, located east of Avenue F. The trailer park is built on the former site of a landfill. As of 2014, it contains 190 manufactured houses and 50 recreational vehicles. The area has been the site of multiple redevelopment attempts including a 2008 attempt at converting the trailer park into a 900+ unit subdivision and a 2014 at an expansion of the park.
