The tiny settlement of traders, hunters, and farmers consisted of simple one and two room log cabins until Abram Gale, for whom Gale Street is named, built the first frame house in Jefferson. Jefferson Park became the hub of an independent township that was incorporated at the nearby Dickinson Tavern as Jefferson Township in 1850 until annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889. The area was once home to a significant population of Volga Germans, and one of the area\\'s one time local landmarks was a local apartment building in the vicinity of the park along Higgins Avenue known by locals as \"the Russian Hotel\".\\nJefferson Park is also home to the Northwest Chicago Historical Society which is dedicated to preserve the area\\'s rich history as well as most historical events and lectures.\\nOn January 21, 2021 a Boutique Air Pilatus PC-12 was landing at the Chicago O\\'Hare Airport when its left main tire separated from the aircraft and landed in Jefferson Park.

President George H. W. Bush hosted the festival in 1992 and in 2000, future Vice-President Dick Cheney as well as Tipper Gore, and Hadassah Lieberman made an appearance.
